#		This is my First Milestone Project for the Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Full Stack Development. 

##		The brief was to create a Web Front End for a fictional 60's band wishing to advertise themselves to fans and potential fans.

##		A number of deliverables have been set by the stakeholders:
###		The fictional band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
###		They are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to these pages.
###		They have provided photos, audio clips and video images to showcase on the website


###		The sample photos, audio and video clips provided by the Code Institute were for The Monkees.  
###		I've dowloaded additional content from a number of sources and modified them to facilitate the theme of this fictional website.  
		
#####	Technologies used:
		
		This Website uses several technlogies & frameworks to deliver its theme, layout and functionality.
		These include Balsamiq, Bootstrap 4, Html5, CSS, Fontawesome & JQuery for the audio playlist.

#### 	Design Overview:

		In additional to the Haley Schafer, Whiskey drop & Resume Mini Project WebPages I sampled 3x Commercial Websites before ultimately deciding upon the layout & theme.
		
		https://thekinks.info/
		http://www.thebyrds.com/
		https://www.thehighkings.com/
		
		I decided to integrate functionality from each of the web pages into my design.
		I particularly liked the layout of the high kings website but felt the home page was too busy.
		I also liked the dark theme of the Byrds webpage and the use of images and hover action from the kinks webpage.	
		
		Ultimately I decided to use multiple pages segmeneted thematically into descrete functions, similar to the Resume mini project.
		I felt there was too much information to be provided from within a single page.  Something that would result in an overwhelming user experience.
		
		I tried several colour schemes but ultimately felt a dark theme with greyscale carousel and band memeber navs worked best. Note* the index-coloured.html page included gives a flavour of a coloured theme.
		
		Alot of what I decided upon depended on the images and icons I found online.  For instance, I initially tried 800x600 images for the carousel but dropped them for 1280x540 images because they didn't facilitate progressive disclosure.
		
####	Development Process

		The Balsamiq mockup tool was used to create the initial wireframe templates.
		
		The Main Page was created using the Bootstrap4 Grid System, Default Navs, Default Carousel & Fontawesome Icons

		The elements were then styled to my preffered theme using CSS.
		
		I noted the absence of Glyphicons in Bootstarp 4 and the difference apporach to the Nav Toggle & Collapse functions.
		
		I used modals with band image overlays for the the newsletter subscription and about sections.
		
		For the Book Now Page I used a standard bootstrap 4 form template which I then modified using CSS to adhere to website template.
		I also added a datepicker faciliaty using html.
		
		For the audio page I decided upon a JQuery playlist as is it allowed for the inclusion of Album graphics and was responsive.
		I then personalised the theme using DevTools and CSS.

		For the Video Gallery page I used straighforward Bootstrap 4 snippets the personalised.

#		Milestone Project 1

This is my First Milestone Project for the Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Full Stack Development. 

##		The Project Brief

The brief was to create a Web Front End for a fictional 60's band wishing to advertise themselves to fans and potential fans.

A number of deliverables have been set by the stakeholders:
- The fictional band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
- They are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to these pages.
- They have provided photos, audio clips and video images to showcase on the website

	
##	Technologies used:
		
This Website uses several technlogies & frameworks to deliver its theme, layout and functionality.
These include Balsamiq, Bootstrap 4, Html5, CSS, Fontawesome & JQuery for the audio playlist.

##	Design Overview:

In additional to the Haley Schafer, Whiskey drop & Resume Mini Project WebPages I sampled 3x Commercial Websites before ultimately deciding upon the layout & theme.
		
- https://thekinks.info/
- http://www.thebyrds.com/
- https://www.thehighkings.com/
		
I decided to integrate functionality from each of the web pages into my design.
I particularly liked the layout of the high kings website but felt the home page was too busy.
I also liked the dark theme of the Byrds webpage and the use of images and hover action from the kinks webpage.	
		
Ultimately I decided to use multiple pages segmeneted thematically into descrete functions, similar to the Resume mini project.
I felt there was too much information to be provided from within a single page.  Something that would result in an overwhelming user experience.
		
I tried several colour schemes but ultimately felt a dark theme with greyscale carousel and band memeber navs worked best. Note* the index-coloured.html page included gives a flavour of a coloured theme.
		
Alot of what I decided upon depended on the images and icons I found online.  For instance, I initially tried 800x600 images for the carousel but dropped them for 1280x540 images because they didn't facilitate progressive disclosure.
		
###		Development Process

The Balsamiq mockup tool was used to create the initial wireframe templates.

The Main Page was created using the Bootstrap4 Grid System, Default Navs, Default Carousel & Fontawesome Icons
The elements were then styled to my preffered theme using CSS.
I noted the absence of Glyphicons in Bootstarp 4 and the difference apporach to the Nav Toggle & Collapse functions.
I used modals with band image overlays for the the newsletter subscription and about sections.
		
For the Book Now Page I used a standard bootstrap 4 form template which I then modified using CSS to adhere to website template.
I also added a datepicker faciliaty using html.
		
For the audio page I decided upon a JQuery playlist as is it allowed for the inclusion of Album graphics and was responsive.
I then personalised the theme using DevTools and CSS.

For the Video Gallery page I used straighforward Bootstrap 4 snippets then personalised further with CSS.


### Deployment

Notepad++ run on my local windows based machine was used in conjunction with the Chrome browser to develop the initial Bootstrap based layout for the index.html webpage.
This was then customised further using Chrome Devtools and CSS.
Once comfortable with the page structure and layout I applied the baseline theme to booking, look, listen and about.html pages.
Note* Discrete  images were used for the carousel on each of the web pages.
The files were uploaded to the Cloud9 IDE, which I used for version control, and an initial git commit was performed.
The Cloud9 repo was then bound to a remote github repo and they were synchronised.
The newsletter modal, booking submit form, listen and READme.md files were then completed and a second commit was initialised.
Github Pages was then used to host and deploy the initial site constructs at the following url.

### Testing

During all phases of development I used Chrome Devtools to test the responsive design functionality.
I also created multiple discrete webpages to test colour schemes and resposive layouts.
The ones that were uploaded to github can be accessed at:

- https://kencormican.github.io/first-milestone-project/index-coloured.html
- https://kencormican.github.io/first-milestone-project/index-nav.html

Once the webpages have been completed I intend on running trials on Opera, Edge, IE-11 and Firefox to confirm functionality 
is consistent across the majority of web browsers.
